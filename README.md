# cs202_Program3

Primary Goal for program #3:

The primary goal for program #3 is to experience operator overloading in an object oriented environment. We want to correctly create classes that properly support the copy constructor, destructor, and now the assignment operator when dynamic memory is involved. Remember that copy constructors in a hierarchy require the use of initialization lists to cause the base class copy constructor to be invoked.

Your primary goal with program #3 is to apply the functionality of the operators, the appropriate arguments (operand data types) and returned types (residual values for the operators) to the following problem. Think about how the operators are used and try to mimic the behavior in your own classes. How is the returned type used? Who controls the memory of the residual value? The client program (lvalue) or the operator (rvalue). Make sure to pass (and return) by reference whenever possible!

Remember OOP:
With OOP the key idea is to break down the problem outlined (below) into small pieces and assign those responsibilities to individual classes. For each assignment, your job will be to create an OO design and program that shows how Object Oriented constructs could be used to solve a real-world problem. You will want to focus on how to design classes that are well structured, efficient, that work together, and where each class has a specific “job”. This time you are adding operator overloading as the new syntax for your solution!

Before you design this program, take a look back at your first two programs. Did you tie the data structures into the midst of your OO designs? Did the designs really become all about the data structure and not so much about the problem at hand? The key to OOP in my opinion is to create the design based on the problem prior to applying the data structure. The data structures are about how we handle the data – not necessarily the key to OOP. For this assignment, your application will be the OOP portion of the assignment. Then, implement the data structures in Abstract Data Types (ADTs) with the full support of operators (via operator overloading).
